Please make sure to run scripts from the root of the project!

To run: `go run core/main.go`
To run tests: `./scripts/run_tests.sh`
To get test coverage after running tests: `./scripts/coverage.sh`
To test that the submission file is the same as the expected output file: `./scripts/compare_files.sh output.txt submission.txt`

If you get `permission denied` on any of the shell scripts use: `chmod 755 [[FILE]]` and run it again
